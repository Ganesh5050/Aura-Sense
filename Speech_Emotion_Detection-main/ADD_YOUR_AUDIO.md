# 🎵 Add Your Own Audio Files for Better ML Training

Your ML model is now working with synthetic data, but you can make it much better by adding real audio files!

## 📁 How to Add Your Audio Files

### 1. Create Emotion Folders
Navigate to: `Speech_Emotion_Detection-main/data/user_audio/`

Create folders for each emotion:
```
data/user_audio/
├── happy/
├── sad/
├── angry/
├── fearful/
├── neutral/
├── calm/
├── disgust/
└── surprised/
```

### 2. Add Audio Files
Put audio files in the appropriate emotion folders:
- **Supported formats**: `.wav`, `.mp3`, `.m4a`, `.flac`
- **Recommended length**: 2-5 seconds
- **File naming**: Any name (e.g., `happy1.wav`, `my_laugh.mp3`)

Example structure:
```
data/user_audio/
├── happy/
│   ├── laugh1.wav
│   ├── excited_voice.mp3
│   └── joy.wav
├── sad/
│   ├── crying.wav
│   └── depressed_voice.mp3
├── angry/
│   ├── shouting.wav
│   └── frustrated.mp3
└── ...
```

### 3. Retrain the Model
After adding your audio files, run:
```bash
python create_sample_dataset.py
```

This will:
- ✅ Keep the existing synthetic data
- ✅ Add your real audio files
- ✅ Retrain the model with combined data
- ✅ Improve accuracy significantly

### 4. Restart Backend
After retraining, restart the backend:
```bash
python app/app.py
```

## 🎯 Tips for Better Results

### Audio Quality
- **Clear recordings**: Minimal background noise
- **Consistent volume**: Not too loud or quiet
- **Pure emotion**: Clear emotional expression
- **Short clips**: 2-5 seconds work best

### Data Balance
- **Equal samples**: Try to have similar numbers of files per emotion
- **Variety**: Different voices, ages, accents
- **Quality over quantity**: 10 good samples > 50 poor samples

### Recording Your Own Audio
You can record your own emotional expressions:
1. Use your phone's voice recorder
2. Express different emotions clearly
3. Keep recordings short (2-5 seconds)
4. Save in the appropriate emotion folder

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

Every time you add more audio files and retrain:
- Model accuracy will improve
- Emotion detection becomes more reliable
- Your app gets smarter!

## 📊 Current Model Status

- **Training Data**: 300 synthetic samples
- **Emotions**: 6 (happy, sad, angry, fearful, neutral, calm)
- **Accuracy**: Will improve significantly with real audio data

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test current model**: Upload audio files to http://localhost:8081
2. **Add real audio**: Follow the steps above
3. **Retrain model**: Run the training script
4. **See improvement**: Test again with better results!

Your emotion detection system will become much more accurate with real training data! 🎭✨
